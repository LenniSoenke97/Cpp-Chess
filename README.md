# Cpp-Chess
A C++ Implementation of Chess.



Welcome to my chess game! I completed this game for a project in my course in MSc Computing Science at Imperial College London.

To see a full game played, simply follow these instructions:

* Download or clone this repository
* When in this (the root) directory, type 'make' into the command line to create the program
* Once that is complete, type 'make run' to see the game in action
